Code used to select participants and download data. 

Participant selection was based on equal representation of location and demographics as well as equally distributed values on callous-unemotional traits (see notes in script for more details).

Note - due to the NDA cite crashing durign donwload we had to run the downloader script twice and then remove any duplicates for use in analysis.
